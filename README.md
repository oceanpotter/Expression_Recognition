# Expression_Recognition

the face is the identity of a person. The methods to exploit this physical feature have seen a great change since the advent of image processing techniques. The accurate recognition of a person is the sole aim of a face recognition system and this identification maybe used for further processing. Traditional face recognition systems employ methods to identify a face from the given input but the results are not usually accurate and precise as desired. 
The system described in this paper aims to deviate from such traditional systems and introduce a new approach to identify expression using a face recognition system i.e. the generation of a 3D Facial Model. This paper describes the working of the face recognition system that will and can be deployed to an Automated Attendance System in a classroom environment or an embedded system in a mobile app or web application.
